# Contributing

Contributing are welcome !

## Husky

To contribute, you will need to install `husky` or else you won't be able to commit new features :worried:

To install `husky` easily, you can just do:

```sh
yarn husky:install
```

## Recommendations

If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), here are some extensions recommendations :

```json
{
    "recommendations": [
        "davidanson.vscode-markdownlint",
        "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
    ]
}
```
