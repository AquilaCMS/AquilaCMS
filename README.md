## Overview
AquilaCMS is an open-source CMS with a wide range of features to satisfy every potential need.

In this project, you can find an API, a default front for the admin side (the backoffice) and a default front for the customer side (the theme).

The features of all these parts (API, backoffice, theme) can be extended by modules that you can develop or find in our [shop](https://shop.aquila-cms.com/).

In addition, for the backoffice and the theme you can develop fronts in all possible technologies (`React`, `Vue.js`, `Angular`, `Next.js`, `Qwik`, `Solid`...).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To install the latest AquilaCMS, you need:

- [`node.js 18.16.0+`](https://nodejs.org/) (tested in v14.20.1+ and v16.18.1+)
- [`yarn 3.4.1+`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) package 
- [`mongoDB 6.0.2+`](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download) (tested in v4.2.5+)manager  (tested in v1.22.19 and v4.0.0-rc.35)

You must verify that you have these packages installed on your OS (especially on Linux):

```bash
g++ gcc libgcc libstdc++ linux-headers make python libtool automake autoconf nasm wkhtmltopdf vips vips-dev libjpeg-turbo libjpeg-turbo-dev
```

You will probably have to download:

  - `wkhtmltopdf`: [https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) (it needs to be in the `PATH`)
  - `libvips`: [https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases) (beware of 32 or 64 bits versions and it also needs to be in the `PATH`)

`wkhtmltopdf` and `libvips` are NOT necessary for the installation of AquilaCMS but are used in certain functions: `wkhtmltopdf` is used when generating pdf and `libvips` when processing cached images (resizing, changing the quality etc).

### Installation
