## Server configuration

To install the latest AquilaCMS, you need :

- `node.js 14+` (tested in v12.17.0)
- `mongoDB 4.2.5+`
- `yarn 1.22.4+` package manager

### System packages

- You must verify that you have these packages installed on your OS :

```bash
g++ gcc libgcc libstdc++ linux-headers make python libtool automake autoconf nasm wkhtmltopdf vips vips-dev libjpeg-turbo libjpeg-turbo-dev
```

- You will probably have to download:

  - `wkhtmltopdf` : [https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) (it needs to be in the `PATH`)
  - `libvips` : [https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases) (beware of 32 or 64 bits versions and it also needs to be in the `PATH`)

## Installation

You can download the source code from GitHub and run the following command-line (not 'Windows cmd') to launch the installer.

- With npm :

```sh
yarn install
npm start
```

- With pm2 :

```sh
yarn install
cp ecosystem.config.example.js ecosystem.config.js
npm run start:pm2
```

- With docker :

```sh
# create a network to link mongo and Aquila CMS
docker network create aquila
# create the mongo instance
docker run --name mongo -p 27017:27017 --network=aquila mongo
# pull the latest and run AquilaCMS
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3010:3010/tcp --network=aquila --name aquila aquilacms/aquilacms
```

> - You can just launch the AquilaCMS image without creating a network if you don't want to connect to a MongoDB launched via Docker
> - if you change the port of the docker container, remember to use the correct `PORT` env variable.

At the first launch, there is an installation page. It allows you to create an `env.json` file in the config folder.

You can edit this file manually, an example of the different possible properties is in the `config/env.example.json` file.
You can also found all the properties in the [documentation](https://doc.aquila-cms.com/#/Get_started/Configuration)

> ### ⚠️Warning : there is not MongoDB in AquilaCMS image
>
> To connect your AquilaCMS website to a Mongo database, you can :
>
> - run a MongoDB image next to the AquilaCMS image like in the example above (and use this mongodb container as hostname : `mongodb://mongo:27017/`)
> - use an external link to, for example, an Atlas database
> - use a localhost link to connect AquilaCMS to a database on your host machine (you have to edit your `mongod.conf` and change your `bindIp` by your network ip instead of `127.0.0.1`)

### Have the installation page again

If you want to have the installation page again, you can remove the `env.json` file in the **`config/`** folder.

### Environment variables

You can define two environment variables inside AquilaCMS.

- `NODE_ENV` : you should only limit values to `production`, `development` or `test` ([See 'Non standard node env'](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/errors/non-standard-node-env.md))
- `AQUILA_ENV` : define the environment values in `/config/env.json` to be loaded

### Manually build the theme

If you want, for any reason, to manually build a theme, you can execute this command at the root of AquilaCMS :

```sh
npm run build:win --theme=default_theme
```

> - Instead of `build:win` you can use `build:linux`
> - At the variable `--theme` you need to put the name of the theme folder you want to build.
